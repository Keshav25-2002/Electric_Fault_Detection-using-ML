# Electric_Fault_Detection-using-ML

This project aims to detect and classify faults in electric power systems using machine learning algorithms. Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability 

and safety of electric power systems. The project uses a publicly available dataset to train and test various machine learning models for fault detection.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the IEEE-CIGRE fault dataset. The dataset contains recordings of various types of faults, including single-phase-to-ground faults, 

line-to-line faults, and three-phase faults, in a transmission system. The dataset contains a total of 5,256 recordings, with each recording having a duration of 2 

seconds.

Model:

The analysis is done using Python, and the models are built using the Scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries. The project is divided into two parts: data preprocessing 

and predictive modeling. In the data preprocessing part, the dataset is preprocessed and features are extracted from the recordings. In the predictive modeling part, 

various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, are used to classify the faults in the recordings.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning algorithms to detect and classify faults in electric power systems. The project showcases how to preprocess the 

dataset and extract features from the recordings. The results of this analysis can be used by power system operators to improve the reliability and safety of electric 

power systems.
